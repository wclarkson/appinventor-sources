	Sediment transport energy
		1. Waves - wind generated transfer of energy w/o net transfer of mass
			bigger body of water -> bigger 'fetch' -> bigger waves
		2. Longshore currents - wave generated by waves hitting shore at an angle
			moves sand along coast like this /|/|/|/
		3. Tides - created by differences in gravitational attraction of sun and moon on water
		4. Storms - make everything bigger, storm surge (mound of water from low pressure area)
			accentuates tides and longshore currents and waves
