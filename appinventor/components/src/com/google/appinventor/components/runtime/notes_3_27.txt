Glaciers and Glaciation
	Evidence - Erratics (rocks from far away)
			   Striations (scratches)

	Theory Development
		1. Diluvial Theory - Noahs flood, evidence called diluvium
		2. Iceberg theory - ice bergs in flood carry rocks, evidence called drift
		3. Glacial theory - glaciers distribute erratics and cause striations
			Jean de Charpentier came up with idea
			Louis Aggassiz found more evidence and came up with Ice Ages

	Glacier - Body of snow + ice formed by the accumulation of snow and refrozen meltwater
			that shows evidence of of past or present movement (flows under own weight or slides if water underneath)

		Requirements:
			1. Landmass (not on ocean)
			2. snow precipitation
			3. Preservation - cold enough

		2 Common occurences (extremes)
			1. Polar climate - very cold with relatively light snow fall (mean ann Temp < 20 deg Celcius, < 20 cm snow)
			2. Temperate Climate - relatively warm w/ very heavy snowfall (mean ann Temp < -5 to -10 deg Celcius, meters or 10s of meters of snow)

	Glacier formation
		1. Accumulation - snowfall, freezing rain
		2. Transformation - 
			snow (sediment) -> Firm -> Ice (cementation) -> Recrystallized Ice (metamorphism)
			A. Compaction
			B. Pressure
			C. Super(im)posed ice growth
			D. Solid state recrystallization @ high pressure
		3. Ablation - melting, calving (icebergs)

	Glacier Mass Balance (Budget) 
		Total Acc = Total Ablation + Mass Balance ( - loss + gain)
